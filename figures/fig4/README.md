# Main figure (Fig. 4)

To produce the main results of Figure 4 you will have to run the training in "/train" folder.
All the subpanels are produced in "train/kf_example.ipynb" and combined in "fig4.ipynb".

# Additional calibration (Fig. 12)

For this you will have to run the evaluation in "/eval" folder. The Figure can then be produced in "eval/coverage_plots.ipynb".
